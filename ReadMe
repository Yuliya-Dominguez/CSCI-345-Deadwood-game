Hello, this is the ReadMe file!

Firstly, you'll need to clone the github repository to get all the .java files and xml data.

Secondly, you'll want to use javac on Main.java to compile the program. You should not need to compile anything else.

Then run the program, and it should ask to enter the number of players. Enter a number between 2 and 8.

Then enter in the names of each player in a row to set up the game.

After that, it will open up a new window that displays the game!

We unfortunately were not able to fully finish our code, but hitting fullscreen will show the whole board (and the scroll panel to move the
    board image up and down).

The move button when pressed will show some text asking where to move, and a drop-down list that when a location is selected, the text will change. The player image will not however.

The upgrade button when pressed will show some text asking what rank to upgrade to with what currency, and a drop-down list that when a rank is selected, the text will change. The player image will not however.

The takerole button when pressed will show some text asking which role to take, and a drop-down list that when a role is selected, the text will change. The player image will not however.
