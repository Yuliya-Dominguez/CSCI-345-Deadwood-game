Hello, this is the ReadMe file!

Firstly, you'll need to clone the github repository to get all the .java files and xml data.

Secondly, you'll want to use javac on Main.java to compile the program. You should not need to compile anything else.

Then run the program, and it should ask to enter the number of players. Enter a number between 2 and 8.

Then enter in the names of each player in a row to set up the game.

After that, it will start with player 1 and start the game!
-type in 'options' in order to see a list of all the available actions a player can take.
-typing in actions must be lowercase with no spaces.


-When moving, the game will ask for the number of the neighbor to travel to. This can be found by looking up the list of neighbors of the location the player is on by typing 'boardstats'.


-When taking a role, the game will ask if the player is taking a role from the scene card or board as an extra. After you type in your lowercase answer, it will ask for a number to represent whcih part you are taking. You can see the number attached to each part by looking at the 'boardstats' or 'scenestats' depending on which one you're taking an acting part from.

-When upgrading, the game will ask the rank you would like to upgrade to. Enter a number between 2 and 6, depending on what you want to upgrade to. Then the game will ask for your payment type, credit or dollar. Type in the name of which one you would like to use. The game will compute and give your result back.

-When acting, the game will automatically roll and print out your success or failure. If all the takes in a set are done, then it will print a message saying the scene is over.

-When trying to quit the game, the system will prompt the user to make sure they want to quit. They can enter y/n or yes/no to give an answer, and the game will react accordingly.

Once 9 scenes are finished, a day will pass and scenes will be drawn again. After 3 (or 4) days, the game will calculate the score and declare the winner!
